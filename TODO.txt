Living document to list what needs/ideally should be done.

TODO: Clean up/move the huge set of notebooks which I am not using

Ideally:
TODO: All plots should have some metadata which corresponds to the software version with which they were produced
TODO: Do huge parameter sweeps on many cores for lawrencium (or even just a local threadripper overnight or something)

TODO: Setup direct comparison to ensure normalization is good

TODO: Ensure propegator solving uses all cores (I think this option needs to be enabled). Ultimately I think mesolve is preferable since this is a master equation solver and not just s.e. solver.
TODO: Add simulation parameters to name or content of cphase plots

NEW OBJECTIVES! Very simple.
1.) Optimize fluxonium-idealgridium gate for pi phase pickup. This is a good proof of concept. Shoot for two 9s to begin
    - DONE!
2.) Proof of simulation via tranmons-fluxonium or fluxonium-fluxonium cphase.
    - Transmon-Fluxonium would require a better understanding of the transmon simulation to match the compact phase of phi.
    - DONE! Requires a bit more polish, but otherwise done!
