Living document to list what needs/ideally should be done.

TODO: Clean up/move the huge set of notebooks which I am not using

Ideally:
TODO: All plots should have some metadata which corresponds to the software version with which they were produced
TODO: Do huge parameter sweeps on many cores for lawrencium (or even just a local threadripper overnight or something)

TODO: Pickle (or see if possible to pickle) common individual quantum objects for use later. This would save a ton of compute time.
TODO: Setup direct comparison to ensure normalization is good
