    "*Would be great if qchard could be upgraded to modern python and QuTip* <br> --RESOLVED (for basic functionality)!\n",

    "\n",
    "### Simulations to do (likely in this order): <br>\n",
    "1. IdealGridium-Transmon, charge coupling (easiest thing to simulate) - *ultra basic functionality done!* <br>\n",
    "2. IdealGridium-Fluxonium (tunable) <br>\n",

    "4. ExpGridium-Fluxonium <br>\n",

    "- Extract the energy shifts as you turn on coupling\n",
    "- Apply the drive via master equation solver.\n",
    "- Maximum population transfer to a ideal C(theta) gate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to watch out for\n",
    "- Readout is coupled to a particular mode. This mode is what we diagonalize on and have some dispersive shift for. However, in the real world, there are other couplings which make the real projected values not as straightforward. Would be interesting at some point to investigate this more thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Holdups\n",
    "\n",
    "To upgrade the versioning (which is highly desired due to the increased stability and increase solve rate) I am mainly running into an issue surrounding the handling of the * operator between lists/numpy arrays and Qobj object.\n",
    "- Version 4.6.0 seems to (at least reading the changelogs) be the one that is causing the issues here.\n",
    "    - RESOLVED! In newer version just needed to be explicit with an inline list comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand why long's code works over mind for non-normalized fidelity.\n",
    "    - RESOLVED! Just needed to take the abs of the matrix element so it didn't weirdly rotate the charge operator\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why the transfer matrix conditioned on certain input states does't trace out to unity\n",
    "    - RESOLVED (mostly)! Seems to be highly sensitive to the particularities of the simulation conditions, most namely, the dimentionality of the two qubits involved. For transmons, this is somewhat difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The protocol here, due to the fact there is a \"separate excitation manifold\" for the 1 state which at protection has all the same transition matrices and coupling constants, effectively dooms the accrual of a conditional phase in the simple mode case. Seems like you can treat the two spaces identically and separate.\n",
    "    - RESOLVED (kinda). While in the ideal case this is a true issue, in the real circuit, we have access to the 'legs' of the KITE, which have current circulating in opposite directions for each \"dual space\". If weakly flux coupled to a qubit with states of differing current flows (say a SQUID), then the new molecule should break the degeneracy. In this case, a flux coupled fluxonium should do the trick (with everything biased correctly of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "- There seems to be population loss when doing a transmon-xqubit gate\n",
    "    - Current most likely candidate is that the transmon is not accurately represented in this LC basis since this basis has a different topology (non-compact vs the compact variable phi for transmons)\n",
    "    - Other general population loss is from leakage when nlev is not high enough. Having nlev be larger typically solves this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual understanding issues\n",
    "\n",
    "- How exactly is the fidelity of the process calculated, given there are different transitions which we all want to preserve as being identity like after the drive\n",
    "- What is sufficient for universal CQ? I assume CPhase is not enough, or perhaps like CPhase where theta can take two different values - RESOLVED: Is simply CPHASE + complete single qubit gateset. In this case, the simplest thing would be something like a Hadamard (H) + T-Gate via a virtual Z gate (this is a pi/8 rotation) + CPHASE gate likely in this manner.\n",
    "- For something like a IdealGridium-Transmon coupling, would flux coupling be better than capacitive (disregarding how that flux coupling would work in practice, given the geometry constraints)? - RESOLVED: Yes! Because the internal node flux of the KITE will be clockwise and anti-clockwise for the two symmetric manifold for 0 transitions and 1 transitions, to break the symmetric detuning that would occur for a coupled qubit in a cphase like gate, we want to do a flux coupling to the internal degree of freedom\n",
    "    - Given the symmetry of the circuit, I feel as if this should be achievable with a charge coupling too, but I don't quite understand why this isn't the case/how it would occur. If I were to hazard a guess, I think it is also within the internal flux nodes of the effective phase slip element. The arrangement is very likely +/- and -/+ for those two nodes and this would yield a useful effect for the coupling. Worth trying in the simulation."

    "For clarity, we want a drivable transition of the gridium to correspond to the transition frequency of an adjacent transmon. So, for example, let's say the 0->3 transition is strong through a capacitive drive. This splitting should be mached to the transmon 0-1 splitting. Now the 0-3 transition will break degeneracy with a state dependence on the transmon 0-1 state. This means driving the gridium 0-3 transition (directly between the 00-03 and 10-13 transition |transmon gridium>) gives a transmon state dependent phase on the gridium, aka a controlled phase (CPHASE).\n",
